This plugin password protects your wordpress blog with a single password.

== Description ==

Want to make your blog private from prying eyes? Well my password protection plugin is perfect for that job; with its intelligent UI and endless features it will make the chore of keeping your data secure and private easy.

> **NOTE** This plugin will not work on WPEngine due to their very aggressive caching.
  
  
> Use w3-total-cache instead of wp-super-cache.  

> Deactivating a caching plugin does NOT always purge the cache. Before deactivating go to the plugin admin page and turn off caching from there.

Premium Features (paid upgrade):  

 - Multiple passwords
 - Choose which pages/posts/categories/tags/urls to protect
